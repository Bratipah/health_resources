In the United States, prices have dropped to an 18-month low, a stark turnaround from last year when they reached their highest level since 2008. In Japan, the benchmark reached an all-time high in September 2022; this benchmark remains high due to the predominance of contracted prices. Historically, regional gas benchmarks differ significantly, largely due to transportation constraints, although price gaps have narrowed in recent years due to rising flows of LNG. The war in Ukraine changed this underlying dynamic by impacting trade flows and benchmarks worldwide. Russian natural gas production was 15% lower than the 2017-21 average in the latter half of 2022 as Russia's was unable to redirect its pipeline exports "

                                    "Amid high European prices, global LNG cargoes were redirected to Europe. In the third quarter of 2022, two-thirds of US LNG exports went to Europe, "
